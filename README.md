# Link State algorithm
Used Python to implement Dijkstra's algorithm with an adjaceny matrix for finding the shortest path between two nodes, figures out the cost to get to the last node and what the next hop is. Gets input from a file and ran the code using the terminal.

First line in text file represents the number of verticies in text fle.
The rows and columns will equal the number of verticies, example if the number of verticies is 6 the number of rows will be 6 and number of columns will be 6.
The last line represents a list of nodes that you want to reach, the final destination.
